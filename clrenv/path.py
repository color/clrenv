"""
Manages environment yaml file paths.

clrenv expects a base environment file (environment.yaml) and zero or more overlay
files.

Without configuration (via env vars) looks for an environment.yaml in the cwd or one of
its parents. This can be set explicitly by setting CLRENV_PATH.

Overlay files can be specified with the CLRENV_OVERLAY_PATH env var. Multiple overlays
can be specified with a colon (:) delimiter. Overlays that do not exist will be ignored.

Values in overlay files take precedence over values in the base file and mask its
values. Note that this is a different mechanism from the base/"mode" sections in each
file which also overlay values. See a full explanation in the docs for EnvReader#read.
